#1. Save Precomputed Proposal Embeddings: The first command runs a distributed training script for a single epoch to save embeddings of precomputed proposals. It specifies CUDA devices and a working directory.
#
#2. Compress Embeddings: This command creates a zip file of the saved embeddings, consolidating them for ease of use and storage efficiency.
#
#3. Save Training Data Embeddings: The next two commands (one commented out) run distributed training scripts to save embeddings of proposals, along with corresponding labels and IoUs with ground truth boxes, for both training and validation data.
#
#4. Consolidate Training and Validation Data: The last two Python scripts gather and consolidate the saved proposal embeddings and other data into .pth files for training and validation, respectively.
#
#These steps are critical for preprocessing and organizing data efficiently, which is crucial for the effective training of DetPro.
